# Better Youth Platform: Executive Proposal

## A Unified Technology Ecosystem for At-Risk Youth in Foster Care

**Prepared for:** Better Youth Board of Directors and Executive Leadership  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

Better Youth has built a unified ecosystem of four interconnected web applications designed to prepare foster and system-impacted youth for sustained careers in animation, film, and the creative economy. This document presents the strategic value, cost advantages, implementation plan, and measurable outcomes of deploying this platform at scale.

The platform consists of:

| Application | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **Better Youth Hub** | Central operations hub — student tracking, staff management, mentor coordination, device management, and workforce outcomes |
| **Unity Code Academy** | Gamified learning platform — XP, levels, badges, and structured learning modules for creative skills |
| **Artistic Ascent** | Portfolio and creative development — showcasing student work and tracking artistic growth |
| **Youth Connect** | Onboarding and engagement — intake, needs assessment, goal setting, and resource matching |

Together, these applications replace fragmented manual processes with a connected digital system that reduces costs, improves outcomes, and scales without proportional staffing increases.

---

## Part 1: The Problem We're Solving

### 1.1 The Current Reality

At-risk youth in foster care face compounding barriers to employment in creative industries:

- **Instability**: Frequent placement changes disrupt education and mentorship
- **Resource gaps**: Lack of equipment, software, and internet access
- **Fragmented support**: Multiple organizations, caseworkers, and programs don't communicate
- **Administrative burden**: Staff spend more time on paperwork than with students
- **Mentor burnout**: Volunteers leave because the emotional load is unsustainable
- **Outcome tracking**: Difficult to prove impact to funders without data

### 1.2 What Happens Without This Platform

| Area | Current State (Manual) | Consequence |
|------|----------------------|-------------|
| Student tracking | Spreadsheets, paper files, email threads | Students fall through cracks, no early warning |
| Mentor matching | Word of mouth, gut feeling | Poor matches, mentor burnout, student disengagement |
| Equipment | Informal sign-out sheets | Lost devices, no accountability, budget overruns |
| Onboarding | In-person intake, paper forms | Slow, inconsistent, data locked in filing cabinets |
| Learning | Ad hoc curriculum, no progress tracking | No way to know what's working |
| Outcomes | Annual surveys, anecdotal evidence | Cannot demonstrate impact to funders |

---

## Part 2: The Value of Each Application

### 2.1 Better Youth Hub (Central Operations)

**What it does:** Manages the entire operation from a single dashboard — students, staff, mentors, devices, support requests, placements, and workforce outcomes.

**Key Value:**

| Benefit | Description | Estimated Impact |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Centralized data** | All student information in one place | 60-70% reduction in time staff spend searching for information |
| **Role-based access** | Students, staff, and mentors each see what's relevant | Reduces errors, protects privacy |
| **Device management** | Track laptops, tablets, cameras, and software licenses | 25-40% reduction in lost/unaccounted equipment |
| **Support request system** | Students can request help digitally, staff can triage | Faster response times, nothing gets lost |
| **Workforce outcomes** | Track placements, internships, jobs, and salaries | Data-driven proof of impact for funders |

### 2.2 Unity Code Academy (Gamified Learning)

**What it does:** Delivers structured learning modules with game mechanics (XP, levels, badges) to keep students motivated and track their skill development.

**Key Value:**

| Benefit | Description | Estimated Impact |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Engagement** | Game mechanics (XP, badges, levels) make learning intrinsically rewarding | 40-60% improvement in module completion vs. traditional methods |
| **Self-paced** | Students progress at their own speed, accommodating life disruptions | Students can pause and resume without falling behind |
| **Skill verification** | Badges and levels provide verifiable credential evidence | Students build portfolios of demonstrated skills |
| **Progress visibility** | Staff and mentors see exactly where each student is | Targeted support instead of guessing |
| **Content scalability** | Add new modules once, deliver to unlimited students | Per-student cost decreases as enrollment grows |

### 2.3 Artistic Ascent (Portfolio & Creative Growth)

**What it does:** Provides a platform for students to showcase their animation, film, and creative work while tracking their artistic development over time.

**Key Value:**

| Benefit | Description | Estimated Impact |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Professional portfolio** | Students build a portfolio that can be shared with employers | Direct pathway to employment opportunities |
| **Growth tracking** | Side-by-side comparison of early work vs. current work | Tangible evidence of development for students and funders |
| **Peer inspiration** | Students see each other's work, creating positive competition | Community building and motivation |
| **Industry exposure** | Portfolios can be shared with studio contacts and recruiters | Bridges the gap between learning and employment |
| **Pride and ownership** | Students own their creative output in a permanent way | Builds identity and confidence |

### 2.4 Youth Connect (Onboarding & Engagement)

**What it does:** Handles the intake process when a new youth enters the program — gathering information, assessing needs, setting goals, and matching them with resources.

**Key Value:**

| Benefit | Description | Estimated Impact |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Streamlined intake** | 5-step guided onboarding replaces paper forms | 70-80% reduction in onboarding time |
| **Needs assessment** | Systematic evaluation of housing, food, transport, healthcare | No critical needs missed during intake |
| **Goal setting** | Students articulate their goals from day one | Sets direction and creates accountability |
| **Resource matching** | Algorithm suggests programs and mentors based on needs and interests | Better matches, less staff time coordinating |
| **Data continuity** | Information flows into Better Youth Hub automatically | No re-entering data, no lost forms |

    DATA FLOWS:
    • Youth Connect → Hub: Student profile, needs, goals
    • Hub → Academy: Student enrollment, learning assignments
    • Academy → Hub: Progress, XP, badges, completed modules
    • Hub → Artistic Ascent: Student portfolio links, growth data
    • Artistic Ascent → Hub: Portfolio items, industry feedback
    • All → Wellness Engine: Activity data for load monitoring
```

### 3.2 Integration Benefits

| Without Integration | With Integration |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Staff re-enters student data across 4 systems | Data entered once, flows everywhere |
| No unified view of student progress | Single dashboard shows full picture |
| Mentor doesn't know what student is learning | Mentor sees real-time learning progress |
| Cannot correlate learning with outcomes | Direct line from skills to placements |
| Wellness check is separate from operations | Load monitoring built into daily workflow |
| Each system has its own login | Single sign-on across all platforms |

### 3.3 Psychophysics Integration Across All Platforms

The psychophysics wellness engine monitors student and mentor load across all four applications:

| Data Source | What It Measures | Wellness Signal |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Youth Connect** | Needs assessment scores, resource gaps | Life stress baseline |
| **Better Youth Hub** | Support requests, device issues, placement changes | Operational stress indicators |
| **Unity Code Academy** | Module completion rate, time-on-task, streak breaks | Learning overwhelm signals |
| **Artistic Ascent** | Submission frequency, revision patterns | Creative engagement or withdrawal |

By combining signals from all platforms, the wellness engine creates a complete picture that no single application could provide alone.

## Part 7: The Full Picture — Why All Four Applications Together

### 7.1 Each Application Alone vs. Together

| Scenario | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| **Hub only** | Operations improve, but no learning platform or creative showcase |
| **Academy only** | Students learn, but no one tracks their life needs or outcomes |
| **Artistic Ascent only** | Portfolios exist, but disconnected from learning journey |
| **Youth Connect only** | Great intake, but nowhere for students to go after onboarding |
| **All four together** | Complete journey from intake → learning → creation → employment |

### 7.2 The Student Journey (End to End)

```
MARIA'S STORY (Hypothetical composite student):

Day 1:    Maria enters through YOUTH CONNECT
          → Needs assessment identifies transportation barrier
          → Matched with nearby mentor who drives
          → Goals set: Learn animation, build portfolio

Week 2:   Maria receives laptop via BETTER YOUTH HUB
          → Device tracked, software pre-installed
          → Onboarding data flows to mentor automatically

Month 1:  Maria starts modules on UNITY CODE ACADEMY
          → Earns first badge (XP: 150, Level 2)
          → Wellness check-in: Stress is moderate (school exams)
          → System auto-adjusts: lighter learning load this week

Month 3:  Maria uploads first animation to ARTISTIC ASCENT
          → Mentor reviews and provides feedback
          → Portfolio begins to take shape
          → Academy progress: Level 8, 12 modules completed

Month 6:  WELLNESS ENGINE detects rising stress
          → Housing placement changed, transport disrupted
          → Auto-alert to staff → new transport arranged within 48 hours
          → Learning paused for 1 week, resumed when stable

Month 9:  Maria's portfolio on ARTISTIC ASCENT shared with studio contact
          → Interview scheduled
          → HUB tracks placement: Internship at animation studio

Month 12: Maria employed part-time at studio
          → OUTCOME TRACKING: $18/hr, 20 hrs/week
          → Still learning on ACADEMY (Level 22)
          → Now mentoring a new student herself

NONE OF THIS WORKS WITHOUT ALL FOUR PLATFORMS CONNECTED.
```

## Recommendation

We recommend the Board approve the deployment of the full Better Youth technology ecosystem with the following motion:

1. **Approve Year 1 budget** of up to $44,000 for platform deployment and staffing
2. **Authorize hiring** a part-time technology contractor for setup and maintenance
3. **Establish an Ethics Board** for oversight of the psychophysics wellness system
4. **Set a 6-month review** to evaluate progress against KPIs
5. **Commit to a 12-month pilot** before deciding on long-term continuation

The technology is built. The applications exist. The cost is a fraction of alternatives. The question is not whether we can afford to do this — it's whether we can afford not to.
