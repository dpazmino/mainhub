## A Unified Technology Ecosystem for At-Risk Youth in Foster Care

**Prepared for:** Better Youth Board of Directors and Executive Leadership  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Version:** 2.0

---

## Executive Summary

Better Youth has built a unified ecosystem of five interconnected web applications designed to prepare foster and system-impacted youth for sustained careers in animation, film, and the creative economy. This document presents the strategic value, cost advantages, implementation plan, and measurable outcomes of deploying this platform at scale.

The platform consists of:

| Application | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **Better Youth Hub** | Central operations hub — student onboarding, staff management, mentor coordination, device management, support requests, and workforce outcomes |
| **Youth Connect** | AI Education Hub — year-long AI curriculum delivered through guided lessons with YouTube integration, teaching students to use AI tools for creative work |
| **Unity Code Academy** | Game development learning — 52 weeks of guided Unity scripting challenges and mini-games, from beginner to advanced |
| **Artistic Ascent** | Creative portfolio and artistic growth — showcasing student animation, film, and creative work while tracking development over time |
| **Azure Connect** | Data analysis and insights — hackathon-style data exploration, impact tracking, technology safety analysis, and PowerPoint report generation |

Together, these five applications replace fragmented manual processes with a connected digital system that reduces costs, improves outcomes, and scales without proportional staffing increases.

    DATA FLOWS:
    • Hub → All Apps: Student enrollment, mentor assignments
    • Youth Connect → Hub: AI curriculum progress, completion rates
    • Unity Academy → Hub: Scripting skills, XP, levels, completed challenges
    • Artistic Ascent → Hub: Portfolio items, creative growth metrics
    • Azure Connect → Hub/Staff: Impact reports, data insights, safety analysis
    • All → Wellness Engine: Activity data for load monitoring
```

### 3.2 Why the Hub is the Center

The Better Youth Hub is where students are connected to everything — mentors, devices, programs, and support. It serves as the single source of truth:

| Without Hub as Center | With Hub as Center |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Staff re-enters student data across 5 systems | Data entered once, flows everywhere |
| No unified view of student progress | Single dashboard shows full picture across all apps |
| Mentor doesn't know what student is learning | Mentor sees AI progress, Unity skills, and portfolio in one place |
| Cannot correlate learning with outcomes | Direct line from skills learned → portfolio built → job placed |
| Each system has its own login | Single sign-on across all platforms |

### 3.3 The Learning Stack

Students progress through three complementary learning platforms, each building different skills:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                          THE LEARNING STACK                                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

LEVEL 1: AI LITERACY (Youth Connect)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Learn to use AI tools for creative work                                      │
│ → Prompt engineering, AI art, AI-assisted editing, AI workflow               │
│ → YouTube-guided lessons, year-long progressive curriculum                  │
│ → OUTCOME: Can use AI as a productivity multiplier                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Learn game development and interactive media creation                        │
│ → Unity scripting, 2D/3D development, mini-game projects                   │
│ → 52 weeks of structured challenges, beginner to advanced                   │
│ → OUTCOME: Can build interactive content studios hire for                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Build a professional portfolio showcasing creative work                       │
│ → Animation, film, design, game projects                                    │
│ → Growth tracking, peer community, industry sharing                         │
│ → OUTCOME: A portfolio that gets students hired                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                    =
              CAREER-READY GRADUATE
              (AI-literate, technically skilled, portfolio in hand)
```

### 3.4 Psychophysics Integration Across All Platforms

The psychophysics wellness engine monitors student and mentor load across all five applications:

| Data Source | What It Measures | Wellness Signal |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Better Youth Hub** | Support requests, device issues, placement changes, mentor interactions | Life stress and operational friction |
| **Youth Connect** | AI lesson completion rate, time between logins, curriculum pacing | Learning engagement or withdrawal from AI track |
| **Unity Code Academy** | Challenge completion rate, time-on-task, streak breaks, level progression | Technical learning overwhelm signals |
| **Artistic Ascent** | Portfolio submission frequency, revision patterns, peer engagement | Creative engagement or burnout |
| **Azure Connect** | Staff usage patterns, report generation frequency | Staff workload and data overwhelm |

By combining signals from all five platforms, the wellness engine creates a complete picture that no single application could provide alone. A student who stops submitting to Artistic Ascent, falls behind on Unity challenges, AND files a support request on the Hub is clearly struggling — even if no single system would flag the issue.

## Part 7: The Full Picture — Why All Five Applications Together

### 7.1 Each Application Alone vs. Together

| Scenario | What's Missing |
|----------|----------------|
| **Hub only** | Operations improve, but no learning platform, no AI curriculum, no portfolio |
| **Youth Connect only** | Students learn AI, but no one tracks their life needs, no mentor coordination |
| **Unity Academy only** | Technical skills are built, but no context for how it fits the bigger picture |
| **Artistic Ascent only** | Portfolios exist, but disconnected from the learning journey that fills them |
| **Azure Connect only** | Data insights exist, but no integrated data sources to analyze |
| **All five together** | Complete journey: Intake → AI skills → Technical skills → Portfolio → Employment |

### 7.2 The Student Journey (End to End)

```
MARIA'S STORY (Hypothetical composite student):

Day 1:    Maria enters through BETTER YOUTH HUB
          → Needs assessment identifies transportation barrier
          → Matched with nearby mentor who works in animation
          → Goals set: Learn AI tools, build game dev skills, create portfolio
          → Receives laptop via device management system

Week 2:   Maria starts AI curriculum on YOUTH CONNECT
          → YouTube-guided lessons on AI art generation
          → Learns to use AI tools for character design
          → Self-paced: can pause when foster placement changes

Month 2:  Maria begins UNITY CODE ACADEMY
          → Week 1-8 challenges: Basic scripting, 2D movement
          → Building her first mini-game
          → WELLNESS ENGINE notices she's managing two curricula well
          → Load score: Green (48%) — healthy pace

Month 4:  Maria uploads first animation to ARTISTIC ASCENT
          → Character she designed with AI tools (Youth Connect)
          → Animated in a Unity scene (Academy)
          → Mentor reviews and provides feedback
          → Portfolio begins to take shape

Month 6:  WELLNESS ENGINE detects rising stress
          → Housing placement changed, transport disrupted
          → AI lessons paused automatically (Youth Connect)
          → Unity challenges reduced to 1/week
          → Hub auto-alerts staff → new transport arranged in 48 hours
          → Maria focuses on portfolio work (lower stress, creative outlet)

Month 8:  Maria's stress stabilizes. Learning resumes full pace.
          → AI curriculum: 65% complete
          → Unity Academy: Level 18, 32 challenges done
          → Portfolio: 6 pieces including game prototype

Month 10: AZURE CONNECT generates impact report
          → Staff presents to board: Maria's progress visualized
          → PowerPoint shows skill growth, portfolio development, placement readiness
          → Board approves expanded cohort funding

Month 12: Maria's ARTISTIC ASCENT portfolio shared with studio contact
          → Interview scheduled
          → Hub tracks placement: Internship at animation studio, $18/hr
          → Maria now mentors a new student herself

NONE OF THIS WORKS WITHOUT ALL FIVE PLATFORMS CONNECTED.
```

## Recommendation

We recommend the Board approve the deployment of the full Better Youth technology ecosystem with the following motion:

1. **Approve Year 1 budget** of up to $48,750 for platform deployment and staffing
2. **Authorize hiring** a part-time technology contractor for setup and maintenance
3. **Establish an Ethics Board** for oversight of the psychophysics wellness system
4. **Set a 6-month review** to evaluate progress against KPIs
5. **Commit to a 12-month pilot** before deciding on long-term continuation

The technology is built. The five applications exist and are operational. The cost is a fraction of alternatives. The question is not whether we can afford to do this — it's whether we can afford not to.

**Every week without this platform is a week where:**
- Students learn without structure
- Mentors burn out without support
- Staff drown in paperwork instead of serving youth
- Funders don't see the impact we're making
- At-risk youth miss their window to enter creative careers
