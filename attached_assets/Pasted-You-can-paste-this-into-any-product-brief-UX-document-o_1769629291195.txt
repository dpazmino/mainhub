Comprehensive Prompt to Build a Multi‑Persona Platform Interface
Build a digital platform that supports three primary personas: (1) Staff & Administrative Users, (2) Students, and (3) Experience‑Journey Users (e.g., mentors, alumni, partners).
The system should present tailored interfaces and permissions based on user profile type (full‑time, part‑time, facilitator, student, alumni, mentor, or partner). All users with learning responsibilities should have access to the learning platform.
1. Staff & Administrative Persona Interface
General Access Rules:
	• Access is determined by employment type (full‑time, part‑time, facilitator).
	• All staff personas must access the learning platform.
Full‑Time Staff Capabilities
	• Administrative dashboard with:
		○ CRM access
		○ Device management tools
		○ Full visibility into personal profiles, including:
			§ Alumni
			§ Current students
			§ Submitted applications
		○ Program KPI analytics, including:
			§ Completed programs
			§ Returning program participants
			§ Program types
			§ Job placement metrics (how many secure full‑time roles and time‑to‑hire)
		○ Learning platform access
Part‑Time Staff Capabilities
	• Device management
	• Learning platform access
Facilitator Capabilities
	• Access to learning sessions
	• Cohort information dashboard
2. Student Persona Interface
Create a student‑centric interface that provides:
	• Assessment tools, including:
		○ Skill‑level evaluations
		○ Resource‑needs analysis
	• Learning platform access with tailored modules and progress tracking
3. Experience‑Journey Persona Interface
Include interfaces and journeys for:
	• Mentors
	• Partnership collaborators (including NEON CRM founder and similar stakeholders)
	• Alumni, including:
		○ Returning alumni journeys
		○ Job‑seeking support and job‑secured tracking
Overall Platform Requirements
Your build should:
	• Provide a clean, intuitive, role‑based interface for all persona types
	• Support conditional access levels depending on user category
	• Offer dashboards, analytics, learning tools, and engagement flows appropriate to each persona
	• Integrate CRM, learning platforms, and device management tools
	• Support end‑to‑end journeys from student entry → program participation → alumni engagement → workforce outcomes
	• Use look and feel layout from Better Youth | Creating Confidence for Foster Youth Through Media Arts
